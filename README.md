# Overview


![Terry, the stopper](/data/terr_stop_cartoon.png)

The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis using the seattle police department database. We have been asked to  provide valuable insight regarding the outcome of Terry stops performed that led to a persons arrest.
As well as a predictive model that can be used to make recommendations to the Police Department to help determine if Terry Stops are neccessary.

# Business Understanding

The police department would like to determine the number of arrests made from Terry Stops aka Stop, Search, and Frisk stops that resulted in a persons arrest.

Using data from Seattle PD Data portal, we would like to detrmine the key features that predict an arrest and make appropriate recommendations.

# Data and Methodology

Data regarding arrest in the city of Seattle was given in one single CSV file. The Dataset contained 61,000+ rows, each pertaining to a reported incident ranging from a number of reported crimes or incidents (reported time, date, etc.) that well called into the police department.
Visualizations of data and brief explanations can be found in the "index" notebook.

We used the follow Dataset:

[Seattle Terry Stop DB](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Terry-Stops/28ny-9ts8/about_data) contains dinformation regarding arrests, incident calls, and frisk performed.

We split a column, arrestt flag, and made it my target based on if the individual was arrested or not.




# EDA

I found 'Final Call Type','Stop Resolution','Subject Perceived Gender', 'Subject Perceived Race','Frisk Flag' are important features in our models.
